This simple plugin allow you to hide certains category, choosen in the settings >> admin-only category settings panel, from all but Admin.

== Description ==

i first like to thanks Wayne Baker, who, somehow, motivated me to reload this plugin with much more improvment.

Now you can check directly in the category admin panel the role you don't want the category to be accessed,
and the implementation of the new advanced categories meta box is much more 'Wordpress compliant'.

thanks to Olly Benson to pointed out and make correction on the last bugs.

== Installation ==


1. Upload `admin-category-only.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Posts » Categories panel and edit your categories by checkin the new checkboxes input that appeared on the bottom of the edit post panel (you must being an admin to do so)
4. Save and you're done, all you have to do now is to set your users to the right role ;)
